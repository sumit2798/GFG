"""
Given a Square matrix mat[] of size NxN. Your task is to find minimum number of operation(s) that are required to make the matrix Beautiful.
A Beautiful matrix is a matrix in which sum of elements in each row and column is equal. 
In one operation you can only increment any value of cell of matrix by 1.
